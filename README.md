# Web design for everybody Capstone

This is the final project for Michigan University online course on Coursera. This course is only open to students who have completed the first four courses in the Web Design for Everybody specialization: Introduction to HTML5, Introduction to CSS3, Interactivity with JavaScript, and Advanced Styling with Responsive Design.

## Portfolio objectives
Your first step is to think about what type of portfolio you would like to make. Will it be about you? How do you want to lay out the content? What is the story you are trying to tell or the information you are trying to convey. The second step will be to consider the different development options (from scratch, from a template, and/or utilizing a development framework). 

### Portfolio Requirements
**Each portfolio must:**
- Have at least three "pages." These can can be three different html files, or one file that links to all three "pages". 
- Each page must have at least two semantic tags (header, nav, footer, etc)
- Each page must validate at validator.w3.org.
- Each page must be responsive -- there must be at least two unique views
- You must have at least 4 images on one of your pages. (If this requirement doesn't "fit" your portfolio plan, please just make an extra page that fulfills it. You can always unlink it after you have been peer -graded.
- Each page must be styled. The goal is not to impress, but to show competence. So add enough to show that you know how to write CSS rules. But peer-review with the knowledge that not everything will be beautiful.

### Grading instructions
- Does the site validate? 10pts
- Is the site responsive? 20pts
- Is the site well-styled? 10pts
- Are the images incorporated effectively? 5pts
- Successfully demonstrated the ability to enhance their site? 40pts (Each extra will be worth 10 pts, for a total of 40 pts)

# My project description
I used a Startbootstrap template Grayscale which is a simple template for a simple one-page layout. The biggest challenge was to understand the CSS (initially more than 10 thousand lines) in order to make it look the way I wanted to and finally to remove the unused part of CSS code. I believe there are still quite some lines that could be removed, but as there are now 1500 lines of code including those parts I added, I’m already happy with the result.
I changed the entire color-scheme (template was black-and-white design), altered background images, added sections and personal enhancements, removed one block rearranged some elements. Quite a challenge was to create the background gradient when every section ha sits own background.

## Validation
**HTML** – one warning, no errors (warning about missing heading - I do not want to add heading to cite section)
**CSS** - fully validated (no warnings, no errors)

## Responsive designs
- created different views/layouts for lg, md and sm screens using media queries

## My personal enhancements
1. added a section to display some nice sayings about fog and used carousel to present four cites. If slide is hovered the invert filter for bg image will be activated.
2. added modal to mermaid img. In case modal is triggered some additional text about mermaids will be displayed too.
3. added JS script to change background picture of the landing page over main heading (FOG)
4. created a separate and completely different view for printing. 
5. created a special favicon for fog – block F on yellow background


## Finally
**You passed!** Congratulations. You earned 100 / 100 points.
